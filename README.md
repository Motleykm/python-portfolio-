Tools & Technology
Hello, I am an aspiring developer with a keen interest in enhancing my skills in Python, SQL, HTML, and eventually expanding my knowledge to other programming languages. This project is designed to showcase the tools and concepts I am exploring and becoming proficient with. It also highlights the knowledge I have gained during my time at Unlock Academy. This project utilizes Python, SQL, HTML, and the Flask framework to build an appointment scheduling form.

Code Exploration:

At the beginning of this program, the user is greeted with an introductory screen, referred to as the program class. This serves as the initial entry point, providing users with an overview of the application's purpose and functionality.

Appointment Form:

The appointment form is a crucial part of this project. It allows users to schedule appointments efficiently. Here are the key features:

User Interface: Built with HTML and styled for a user-friendly experience.
Backend: Powered by Python and Flask, ensuring smooth handling of form submissions.
Database Integration: Utilizes SQL to store appointment details securely.
Confirmation Numbers: Each appointment is assigned a unique confirmation number for easy tracking and management.
Cancellation Function: Users can cancel appointments via a dedicated function, which updates the database and marks the time slot as available.
Change Appointment Function: Allows users to reschedule or modify their appointments seamlessly.
Tkinter Calendar Integration: Displays hairdresser appointment times, allowing customers to reserve available slots. The calendar dynamically updates to show only open times for each hairdresser.
This comprehensive approach ensures that the appointment scheduling system is robust, user-friendly, and adaptable to future enhancements.
